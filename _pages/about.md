## Hi there! 👋

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Purdue University, advised by [Prof. Yi Ding](https://y-ding.github.io/index.html). Before joining Purdue, I spent one year in Alibaba Cloud, building cloud-native deep learning infrastructure for distributed training and resource scheduling. Previously, I obtained both of my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I was supervised by [Prof. Ruhui Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PcrtqDsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Tao Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tIjK-3QAAAAJ&hl=en). I also worked with [Prof. Yang Hua](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N0tFi8MAAAAJ&hl=en). 

 My research focuses on machine learning systems, with an emphasis on improving the efficiency and sustainability of Large Language Models (LLMs) through environmental impact evaluation, system-level optimizations, and the use of heterogeneous hardware platforms.
